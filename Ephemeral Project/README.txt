Platform requirements: Chrome browser, internet connection

Instructions:
There are two folders in my main folder - one where the control condition is first, and one where the ephemeral condition is first. Depending on which condition the user is testing, open either /control/index.html or /ephemeral/index.html. No other steps are required to run the system.
After each condition, a page will open to download the cvs file with the time data.
