		<h1>In this experiment, you will be shown a menu bar with three menus. Mousing over one of the menus will open a dropdown menu with four sets of four items each. At the top of the page, you will be shown a menu that you have to open, and an item that you have to click on in that menu, which will be in the format Menu # > Item. For example, you may see Menu 1 > Apple. You would then click on menu 1 and then find and click on apple.</h1>
		<h1> In this portion, the item that you need to click on will be shown instantly once you open a menu, while other items will fade in after a short time. The items that fade in quicker are items that the system predicted would be most likely needed. Please click on the item shown as quickly as possible.</h1>

		<h1>To familiarize you with the system, you will have 8 practice sets to go through. Your current trial number and the total number of trials will be on the top of the page so you can track your progress. When you are ready to start the practice tasks, click "Continue". </h1>
